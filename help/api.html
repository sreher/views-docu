Views allows modules to describe their tables relationships to each other, as well as fields, filters, sort criteria and arguments via <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions--views--docs--views.api.php/function/hook_views_data/7">hook_views_data()</a></strong>. Whenever Views deems it necessary, this hook is called, the data aggregated together and cached. <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions--views--docs--views.api.php/function/hook_views_data/7">hook_views_data_alter()</a></strong> may also be used to modify existing data, changing other module's handlers or adding handlers to other module's tables.

Views now uses Drupal's dynamic-loading code registry. You can safely remove your implementations of hook_views_handlers(), since they are no longer used. See more information <a href="topic:views/api-handlers">here</a>.
<!-- Views also allows modules to create new display types, style types, row styles, argument default handlers and argument validators via <strong><a target="_blank" href="topic:views/api-handlers">hook_views_handlers()</a></strong> and <strong>hook_views_plugins()</strong>. -->
These hooks are kept in a file named MODULENAME.views.inc. This file is automatically included upon need, so there is no need to try and include this in hook_init or any other method of including .inc files. This file should store hook_views_data, hook_views_data_alter(), hook_views_plugins(), hook_views_handlers(), as well as any other hooks and subsidiary data that will only be used by your module when Views is active. All handlers and plugins provided by your module should be in separate .inc files.

There are two similar files, MODULENAME.views_default.inc and MODULENAME.views_convert.inc which contain default views and views 1 to views 2 convert helpers, respectively.

<h3>hook_views_api()</h3>
<strong>In order for your files to be included, your module must first implement hook_views_api()</strong> in the main .module file. This module should return array of information. The following items may be returned:

<dl>
<dt><strong>api</strong></dt>
<dd>This must appear; it should be the oldest API version that your module can work with. If Views is currently running an older version of the API, it will ignore your module's views integration. This is a good thing, as it will prevent code crashes, at the expense of your module's functionality disappearing.
<br />
You may find the current Views API version by calling <strong>views_api_version()</strong> which is implemented at the top of views.module. This version numbering starts at 2.0. Every time changes are made to the Views handlers and plugins or other aspects of the Views API, the number will tick up (by either .001, .01 .1 or 1 depending upon how major the changes are). Note that <strong>views_api_version()</strong> was introduced in Views 2.0-rc2 and may not exist prior to that version. You may use drupal_function_exists() to test to see if this function is there.
<br />
Often these versions are basically compatible with each other and Views won't care if your module implements 2.000, 2.001, 2.002, etc. Your module can request that it won't work with any version older than a given version, however. Views will determine, itself, if a newer version will work.
</dd>
<dt><strong>path</strong></dt>
<dd>If your *.views*.inc files are not in the same directory as the .module file, then return the full path here. You should probably use something like drupal_get_path('module', 'yourmodulename') . '/includepath'.</dd>
<dt><strong>template path</strong></dt>
<dd>A path where the module has stored it's views template files. When you have specificed this key views automatically uses the template files for the views. You can use the same naming conventions like for normal views template files.</dd>

<h4>API Hooks</h4>
When you look at the Views API Documentation, you will find a list of <a href="">views_hook</a>.
<table>
	<tr><td>hook_views_admin_links_alter()<td></td>This hook should be placed in MODULENAME.views.inc and it will be auto-loaded. This must either be in the same directory as the .module file or in a subdirectory named 'includes'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_api()</td><td>Register View API information. This is required for your module to have its include files loaded; for example, when implementing hook_views_default_views().</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_convert()</td><td>Stub hook documentation</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_data()</td><td>Describe table structure to Views.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_data_alter()</td><td>Alter table structure.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_default_views()</td><td>This hook allows modules to provide their own views which can either be used as-is or as a "starter" for users to build from.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_default_views_alter()</td><td>This hook is called right before all default views are cached to the database. It takes a keyed array of views by reference.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_form_submit()</td><td>Views form (View with form elements) submit handler. Called for all steps ($form_state['storage']['step']) of the multistep form.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_form_substitutions()</td><td>This hook is called to get a list of placeholders and their substitutions, used when preprocessing a View with form elements.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_form_validate()</td><td>Views form (View with form elements) validate handler. Called for all steps ($form_state['storage']['step']) of the multistep form.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_handlers()</td><td>Register handler, file and parent information so that handlers can be loaded only on request.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_plugins()</td><td>The full documentation for this hook is now in the advanced help.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_plugins_alter()</td><td>Alter existing plugins data, defined by modules.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_post_build()</td><td>This hook is called right after the build process. The query is now fully built, but it has not yet been run through db_rewrite_sql.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_post_execute()</td><td>This hook is called right after the execute process. The query has been executed, but the pre_render() phase has not yet happened for handlers.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_post_render()</td><td>Post process any rendered data.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_preview_info_alter()</td><td>This hook should be placed in MODULENAME.views.inc and it will be auto-loaded. This must either be in the same directory as the .module file or in a subdirectory named 'includes'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_pre_build()</td><td>This hook is called right before the build process, but after displays are attached and the display performs its pre_execute phase.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_pre_execute()</td><td>This hook is called right before the execute process. The query is now fully built, but it has not yet been run through db_rewrite_sql.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_pre_render()</td><td>This hook is called right before the render process. The query has been executed, and the pre_render() phase has already happened for handlers, so all data should be available.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_pre_view()</td><td>This hook is called at the very beginning of views processing, before anything is done.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>hook_views_query_alter()</td><td>Stub hook documentation</td></tr>
